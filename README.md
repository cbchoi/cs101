# Notes
These materials are created by Prof. Otfried Cheong at KAIST. 
Since the original version teaching materials are implemented using Python 2.7, 
I have modified the materials to support Python 3.X. 
You may find the orignal codes and teaching materials in the KAIST folder.

## Modifications
+ Python Image Library -> Pillow
+ Changing Python 2.7 syntax to Python 3.X sytanx
